# Crypto Wallet Dashboard

To get started, just hit the `Run` button! You will see a preview of a live webpage. If you press `Get Wallet Balance` in the web app, you will retrieve all the token balances for the default wallet address: `demo.eth` on the default network: `Ethereum Mainnet`. 


1. Select the `Avalanche-Fuji C-Chain Testnet` network and enter in your Avalanche C-Chain wallet address (used in a previous challenge). Hit `Get Wallet Balance` and confirm that the `AVAX` balance shown matches that of your wallet on the Fuji Testnet. 

The [balances_v2](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#get-/v1/1/address/{address}/balances_v2/) API endpoint returns a list of all ERC20 and NFT token balances along with their current spot price in `USD`.
